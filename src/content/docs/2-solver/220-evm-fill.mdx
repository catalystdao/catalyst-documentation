The delivery of assets depends on the Output Settlement Interface associated with an order. The Output Settlement Interface can be read from the order: `orderDto.order.remoteFiller`.

### BaseFiller based (CoinFiller)

The CoinFiller is the simplest Output Settlement implementation and allows specifying limit orders and dutch auctions.

:::caution
Support is not provided for dutch auctions yet.

To fill an output using Output Settlements based on `BaseFiller` use the associated fill interfaces:

```solidity
function fill(bytes32 orderId, OutputDescription calldata output, bytes32 proposedSolver) external returns (bytes32) {
  return _fill(orderId, output, proposedSolver);
}

function fillThrow(bytes32[] calldata orderIds, OutputDescription[] calldata outputs, bytes32 filler) external {
  _fillThrow(orderIds, outputs, filler);
}

function fillSkip(bytes32[] calldata orderIds, OutputDescription[] calldata outputs, bytes32 filler) external {
    _fillSkip(orderIds, outputs, filler);
}
```

Filling a single output description is most efficient with `fill(...)` since it does not contain a for loop. However, it is limited to a single output at a time.

For batch filling, `fillThrow` or `fillSkip` may be better.
- `fillThrow` fills all outputs but if one has been already been filled by another solver the whole call will revert.

  Use it when an output has multiple outputs and you are filling all outputs of an order or none.

- `fillSkip` fills all outputs but if some has already been filled, those will be skipped silently.

  Use it when you are batch filling multiple orders. This allows you to claim as many outputs as possible in one go since even if one order got filled by another solver you will still fill the rest.

## Validation Layers

Once orders have been filled on the output settlement contract, they need to be submitted to the validation layer to be ferried to the input chain. The first step is to generate the associated payload. The [reference payload encoding format](/#standardized-message-format) is:

```
Encoded FillDescription
     SOLVER                          0               (32 bytes)
     + ORDERID                       32              (32 bytes)
     + TIMESTAMP                     64              (4 bytes)
     + TOKEN                         68              (32 bytes)
     + AMOUNT                        100             (32 bytes)
     + RECIPIENT                     132             (32 bytes)
     + REMOTE_CALL_LENGTH            164             (2 bytes)
     + REMOTE_CALL                   166             (LENGTH bytes)
     + FULFILLMENT_CONTEXT_LENGTH    166+RC_LENGTH   (2 bytes)
     + FULFILLMENT_CONTEXT           168+RC_LENGTH   (LENGTH bytes)
```

It may be beneficial to batch multiple proven outputs to the validation layer.

### Simple Broadcast Interfaces (Wormhole)

For messaging protocols supporting simple broadcast interfaces like Wormhole, the following interface is used:

```solidity
function submit(address proofSource, bytes[] calldata payloads) public payable returns (uint256 refund);
```

Where `proofSource = orderDto.order.remoteFiller` and  `payloads` is the encoded OutputDescriptions.
