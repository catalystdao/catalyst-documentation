Catalyst supports 3 order types: Limit order (First come, first serve / gas auction), Dutch Auction (on-chain), and off-chain auctions.

Each Output encodes a specific order type. Generally all ouputs will be of the same order type. (But this is enforced.)

For an order with multiple outputs, the filler of the first output will **ALWAYS** be the recipient of the inputs. The inputs can't be claimed until all outputs are filled.

The _auction_ happens on-chain with the winner determined by speed.

### Limit Order (First come, First serve)

Catalyst limit orders are simple: single price, first execution. That means the amount set in `OutputDescription` is final and will be what you are paying. The Output can be filled once per `orderId` (Output is hashed and stored in a map with `orderId`).

The winner of an order is the first solver to call `fill` and set their identifier for the output.

You can identify Limit Orders by **both** `fillerAddress` and `fulfillmentContext`. `fulfillmentContext` shall be either `0x` or `0x00`.

### Dutch Auction

Catalyst dutch auctions are slightly more complicated. The fulfillment context will have the slope and stopTime encoded.

The winner of an order is the first solver to call `fill` and set their identifier as the output. Notice that the win selection is equivilant to the limit order EXCEPT the earlier the fill is called, the more the solver pays.

You can identify Limit Orders by **both** `fillerAddress` and `fulfillmentContext`. `fulfillmentContext` shall be either `0x01 | uint256(slope) | uint256(stopTime)` with the final amount being computed as: 

```solidity
uint32 currentTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
uint256 timeDiff = stopTime - currentTime;
return amount + slope * timeDiff;
```

The auction happens on-chain with the winner determined by speed THUS also price.

### Off-chain Auctions

Catalyst off-chain auctions allows for complex auction logic at the cost of centralisation. An order can choose an off-chain entity to execute an auction on its behalf.

That entity shall then sign and append informatin to the `Output` which the winner of the auction can then redeem on-chain.

You can identify Off-chain auctions by their `fillerAddress`

The first off-chain auction will be a classical english auction; The winner will be determined as the first person with the highest bid within the auction window.

The auction happens off-chain with the winner determined by the best price within the auction window.
