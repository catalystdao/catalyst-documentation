Catalyst can be deployed on two categories of chains:

1. Existing chains
2. New chains

## Existing Chains

Catalyst, in its base essence, is a smart contract protocol that can be deployed onto any chain it supports. Over time, we plan for permissionless deployments on all blockchain environments.

## New Chains

Any new chain built using supported modular chain tooling (e.g., Rollups-as-a-Service) will be able to use Catalyst as a "liquidity module" to automatically and permissionlessly connect liquidity from the new chain to any designated chain. More details on this soon.

## Interested in deploying Catalyst?
