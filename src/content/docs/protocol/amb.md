# Arbitrary Messaging Protocol

Catalyst protocol is agnostic to interoperability protocol and can leverage any arbitrary message bridge (AMB) to send the UoL across chains. This results in two main advantages:

- The attack surface is limited to a single bridge message as opposed to 4-6 attack surfaces of existing solutions.
- Developers can choose the best AMB depending on their use-case or rollup stack.
