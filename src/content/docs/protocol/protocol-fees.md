## Catalyst Transaction Fees

To begin, each swap through the Catalyst protocol incurs a transaction fee of 5 bps (i.e., 0.05%). This can be configured by governance in the near future.

Of the 5 bps, Liquidity Providers (LPs) will receive all 5 bps, and the Catalyst Protocol Treasury will 0 bps. This distribution of the transaction fee can also be later configured by governance.
