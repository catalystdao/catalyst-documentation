Catalyst is designed with ease of deploymeny in mind. Catalyst can be permissionlessly deployed to any chain and connected it to the existing Catalyst network.

Currently Catalyst has 2 implementations, allowing us to support any chain that supports either:

- EVM
- CosmWasm

## Deploying Catalyst

You can find the deployment instructions on the relevant github pages. This pages will be updates with better instructions in the future.
