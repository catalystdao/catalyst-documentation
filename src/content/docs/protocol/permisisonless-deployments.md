Catalyst is designed with ease of deployment in mind. Catalyst can be permissionlessly deployed to any chain and connected it to the existing Catalyst network.

Catalyst can be deployed on two categories of chains:

1. Existing chains
2. New chains

For existing chains: Catalyst, in its base essence, is a smart contract protocol that can be deployed onto any chain it supports. Over time, we plan for permissionless deployments on all blockchain environments.

Currently Catalyst has 2 implementations, allowing us to support any chain that supports either:

- EVM
- CosmWasm

For new chains: any new chain built using supported modular chain tooling (e.g., Rollups-as-a-Service) will be able to use Catalyst as a "liquidity module" to automatically and permissionlessly connect liquidity from the new chain to any designated chain. More details on this later.


## Deploying Catalyst

You can find the deployment instructions on the relevant github pages. This pages will be updated with better instructions in the future.
