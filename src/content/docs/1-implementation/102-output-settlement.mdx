Catalyst's first filler – `CoinFiller.sol` – supports 2 order types: simple limit orders and dutch auctions.

## CoinFiller

To configure whether to use limit order or dutch auction, set the associated `fulfillmentContext` on the `OutputDescription`.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const outputDescription = `
struct OutputDescription {
    ...
    bytes remoteCall;
    bytes fulfillmentContext;
}`;

<Code code={outputDescription} lang="solidity" mark={['bytes fulfillmentContext;']} />

Using the following pesudocode.

```solidity
uint256 slope;
uint256 stopTime;
"limit" | "dutch" orderType;

if (orderType == "limit") fulfillmentContext = "0x" || fulfillmentContext = "0x00";
if (orderType == "dutch") fulfillmentContext = abi.encodePacked(0x01, slope, stopTime)
```

Specifically for dutch auction, if the order contains multiple outputs only the first one will work as an auction and the last ones will resolve to the worst price. That is because solvers are only incentivised to compete on the first output in an order since the winner of that order is the winner of the entire order _once anyone_ fills the rest of the outputs.
