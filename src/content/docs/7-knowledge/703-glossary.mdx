## Arbiter
An entity, contract, or mechanism capable of determining when the desired action of a resource lock has been fulfilled. It may also act as an allocator.

## Allocator
An entity that validates that a lock does not exceed a userâ€™s current balance. It may also act as an arbiter. When depositing into a lock, an allocator is chosen.

## GMP
Generalized Message Passing. Describes a method to send messages between two chains. Examples include Wormhole, LayerZero, Hyperlane, and more.

## Lock
An allowance issued by a user to an arbiter. Before locks are valid, they must be signed by the user and co-signed by the allocator.

## Input
The starting point. Input assets refer to the assets paid into the intent system. The input chain refers to the chain(s) of the input assets.

## Integrator
Someone who issues intents for a cross-chain intent system.

## Intent
An issuance of a desired action. Intents are often used to describe swaps but can also describe desired cross-chain interactions. Unlike swaps, intents should generally be composable. Intents are usually self-contained, meaning they describe both the desired end state and the payment to achieve that state; the output and input, respectively.

## Output
The endpoint. Output assets refer to the desired tokens to be paid to the user (or used within a larger action). The output chain refers to the chain(s) of the output assets.

## Resource Lock
A clever 3/3 (or 2/2) multisignature scheme that provides unique balance abstractions. [See more](/knowledge/resource-locks).

## Settler
A contract in a cross-chain intent system that delivers assets. In a resource lock supporting cross-chain intent system, the input/origin settler is often an arbiter.

## Solver
An actor that solves intents for users. They participate in the intent system with the goal of earning margins from the difference between the cost of achieving the end state and the inputs.

## Sponsor
The owner of the tokens to be used for locks in a resource lock.

## Validator Layer
An entity capable of validating whether certain information has occurred. Examples include GMP, optimistic proof, or bridges.
