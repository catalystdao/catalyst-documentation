## Arbiter
Entity, contract or otherwise, capable of determining when the desired action of a resource lock has been fulfilled. may also be an allocator.

## Allocator
Entity validating that lock does not exceed a userâ€™s current balance. may also be an arbiter. When depositing into a lock, an allocator is chosen.

## Sponsor
The owner of the tokens to be used for a locks in a resource lock.

## Resource Lock
A clever 3/3 (or 2/2) multisignature scheme that provides unique balance abstractions. See more.

## Lock
An allowance issued by a user to an Arbiter. Before locks are valid they have to be signed by the user, and co-signed by the allocator.

## Validator Layer
Entity capable of validating whether some information happened. Examples: GMP, optimistic proof, or bridges.

## GMP
Generalised Message Passing. Describes a way to send messages between 2 chains. Examples: Wormhole, LayerZero, Hyperlane, and more.

## Settler
A contract in a cross-chain intent system that delivers assets. In a resource lock supporting cross-chain intent system, the input/origin settler is often an arbiter.

## Integrator
Someone issuing intents for a cross-chain intent system.

## Intent
An issue of a desired action. Intents are often used to describe swaps but can also describe desired cross-chain interactions. Contrary to swaps, intents should generally be composable. Intents are usually self-contained meaning they describe both the desired end state and the payment to someone to reach that state; the output and input respectively.

## Solver
An actor solving intents for users. They participate in intents system with the goal to earn margins of the difference between the cost of achieving the end state and the inputs. 

## Input
The starting point. Input assets refers to the assets paid into the intent system. The input chain refers to the chain(s) of the input assets.

## Output
The end point. Output assets refers to the desired paid tokens to the user (or used within a greater action). Output chain refers to the chain(s) of the output assets.
