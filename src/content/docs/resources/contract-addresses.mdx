All Catalyst and associated contracts are deployed using create2. This lets anyone deploy Catalyst to any chain and lets anyone verify that a deployment is authentic by only checking the associated addresses. Some contracts have dependencies outside Catalyst and those addresses may change based on other factors and as a result addresses may not be the same across-chain.
