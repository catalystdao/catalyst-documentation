Catalyst's eggs program began on May 21 at 00:00 UTC.

Eggs are distributed weekly to Catalyst users for 3 months. The first distribution will take place May 30. Eggs are meant to reward users who contribute to the protocol’s success.

Eggs criteria will be updated on a recurring basis. Eggs distributions are based on weekly activity ending Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC. Distributions take place on Thursdays. Catalyst reserves the right to modify previous eggs distributions under its sole discretion.

### Points to Boxes conversion
At the end of the season, eggs will be converted into boxes with randomised rarities. There are 4 types of boxes: Uncommon, Rare, Legendary and Mythical. Each box holds a different amount of reward depending on its rarity (Mythical boxes are worth 100x Uncommon boxes).

### Loyalty Score
The loyalty score tracks user activity over time and is represented as a number between 0 and 100. This score is user-specific and is updated weekly—it can decrease, increase, or remain the same. Users who stay active throughout the entire season will accrue a higher loyalty score. The loyalty score doesn't affect the number of Boxes you receive, but it does affect your luck when revealing them.

## Referrals

### How do I refer someone to Catalyst?

You can create a referral code on app.catalyst.exchange/code after connecting your wallet. You will receive a percentage of referred users' eggs based on their weekly activity. The percentage is determined by your referral tier.

Share your referral code with other traders using a unique link: app.catalyst.exchange/join/YOURCODE.

### How do I use a referral code?
Click on a referral code link or input a friend's referral link on catalyst.exchange/join

###  Kickback

Using a referral code will give you a variable kickback determined by the referee. The kickback works exactly like a credit card cashback, meaning that you’ll get a % of your weekly Eggs back. The higher your referral tier, the larger the kickback you can offer to your friends. You can check how much the kickback is when you click on a referral code link.

Example:
Bob is Silver tier (20% referral rewards) and offers a 10% kickback.

Alice signs up on Catalyst using Bob's code.

At the end of the week, Alice earns 100 Eggs based on her Catalyst activity.

Bob will earn (100 * 20%) - 10% = 18 Eggs, while Alice will receive 2 additional Eggs as a kickback.

Note: the kickback can only be increased but not decreased over time. Referral signups are immutable. Once you sign up using a code, you won't be able to change it later on.
