Catalyst is [ERC-7683](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7683)* compatible. *The implementation differs in 2 ways:

1. A Catalyst [OrderKey](https://github.com/catalystdao/cross-cats/blob/7e07281eef10ffadc10f9f75eb42d1c2419224ca/src/interfaces/Structs.sol#L41-L65) is returned on `initiate(...)`. For implementations that wants to verify that orders were correctly collected, this adds an option for further data validation. This change is compatible with ERC-7683 since it does not change any function signatures and ERC-7683 specifies that the function has no return. For naive implementations this slightly increases gas costs as Solidity always places `RETURNDATACOPY` after external calls.
2. ERC-7683 defines the 2 elements of `Output`: `token` and `recipient` to be type `address`. The type of both elements have been changed to `bytes32`. Solidity ABI encoding encodes structs elements such that they fill 32 bytes. As a result, all returned objects of `ResolvedCrossChainOrder` remains compatible with implementations that assumes these are `address` (except when read, those values are truncated). When possible, important contextual information is placed in the 20 rightmost bytes. Off-chain listeners should always read the entire 32 bytes.
