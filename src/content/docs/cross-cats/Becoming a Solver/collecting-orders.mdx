On VM chains, assets can be pulled from users via approvals – a feature not available on non-VM chains – instead the sequence of operation has been modified to allow the user to push assets to the solver. The easiest routes originate from a VM chain – these routes are generally permissionless – while routes originating from BTC are more difficult – these routes are generally permissioned.

## Pulling Orders

The simplest way to collect orderflow from EVM is via polling. The order server stores orders in a dictionary format, allowing for straightforward parsing by integrators and provides a high level of transparency in the implementation.

:::tip[Only order originating from VM chains can be pulled]
The order server only stores user signed orders. Since users can only sign order originating from VM chains, orders originating from non-vm chains – including from Bitcoin – cannot be pulled.

## Subscribing to Orders

Subscribing to orders allow you to listen directly to the order flow. This section outlines how to subscribe to new orders using a WebSocket connection, allowing for real-time updates without the need to continuously poll the order server. By leveraging WebSocket, the Catalyst order server broadcasts new orders as they arrive, offering a significant reduction in latency but at the cost of increased complexity due to the need for a persistent connection and local filtering of incoming data.

Instead of polling for new orders, you can establish a WebSocket connection to the Catalyst order server. The server provides a WebSocket endpoint that pushes new order data to subscribers in real time. However, unlike polling, the data received through WebSocket is not pre-filtered. This means every order event will be pushed to your application, and it’s up to your implementation to manage and filter these events locally.

Below is a simplified implementation in pure JavaScript that demonstrates how to connect to the WebSocket server, handle incoming messages, respond to ping events, and automatically attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost.

:::caution[Quote requests are optional but required for BTC to USDC]
It is optional to handle `quote-request` and `quote-request-binding` event, however, if you want to solve BTC to USDC you have to respond to the `quote-request-binding` event. The response you make to this event is binding for 30 seconds. If you receive a message with the event `non-vm-order` you have to fill it – by correcting empty slots & signing it – or you may get blacklisted.

(TODO update typescript block)
```typescript
  const WebSocket = require("ws");

  // Configuration variables
  const wsUri = process.env.ORDER_SERVER_WS_URI; // Set your WebSocket server URI
  const apiKey = process.env.ORDER_SERVER_API_KEY; // Set your API key
  const reconnectInterval = 5000; // Reconnect interval in milliseconds

  let ws;

  // Function to connect to the WebSocket server
  function connectToOrderServer() {
    ws = new WebSocket(wsUri, {
      headers: {
        "x-api-key": apiKey,
      },
    });

    ws.on("open", () => {
      console.log("Connected to WebSocket server");
    });

    ws.on("message", (data) => {
      try {
        const parsedData = JSON.parse(data.toString());
        console.log("Received message:", parsedData);

        switch (parsedData.event) {
          case "ping":
            handleReceivePing();
            break;
          case "quote-request":
            handleReceiveQuoteRequest(parsedData, ws);
            break;
          case "order":
            handleReceiveOrder(parsedData, ws);
            break;
          default:
            console.log("Unknown message type:", parsedData);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error parsing JSON:", error);
      }
    });

    ws.on("error", (error) => {
      console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
    });

    ws.on("close", () => {
      console.log("Disconnected from WebSocket");
      reconnect();
    });
  }

  // Function to handle ping messages, you will be automatically disconnected if you don't respond to ping messages
  function handleReceivePing() {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ event: "pong" }));
  }

  // Function to handle quote requests
  function handleReceiveQuoteRequest(data, ws) {
    console.log("Handling quote request:", data);
    // Add your custom handling logic here
  }

  // Function to handle orders
  function handleReceiveOrder(data, ws) {
    console.log("Handling order:", data);
    // Add your custom handling logic here
  }

  // Function to attempt reconnection
  function reconnect() {
    console.log("Attempting to reconnect...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      ws.close(); // Close any existing connection
      connectToOrderServer(); // Attempt to reconnect
    }, reconnectInterval);
  }

  // Start listening to the order server

## Evaluating Orders

After fetching an order, the solver must thoroughly evaluate it to determine its viability and potential execution. To facilitate this evaluation, several contextual pointers are available within the returned order data. Key aspects to consider include:

1. **Quote Validation**: Use the `OrderDto.quote` field to access the price context, which provides the pricing details for the inputs and outputs of the order. If you trust the order server, you can primarily rely on this quote to validate the order’s pricing. However, it’s crucial to verify that the solver supports the specific origin chain (`OrderDto.order.originChainId`) and output chains (`OrderDto.order.orderData.outputs[...].chainId`) as well as their respective tokens (`input[].token` and `output[].token`). These parameters are guaranteed to be present across all order types.

2. **Solver-Exclusive Orders**: Some orders may initially be restricted to specific solvers. This is indicated by the `OrderDto.order.orderData.verificationContract` field. If this field is defined and not equal to `address(0)`, the order is exclusive to the designated solver until the `slopeStartingTime` elapses, after which the order becomes available for anyone to fulfill.

3. **Mutually Exclusive Orders**: Be aware of potential conflicts between orders. If you encounter two orders with the same `OrderDto.order.swapper` and `OrderDto.order.nonce`, these orders are mutually exclusive, meaning only one of them can be submitted on-chain. This mechanism prevents double submissions and ensures the integrity of the order processing.

Evaluating orders carefully ensures that solvers can accurately determine the feasibility of executing an order, adhere to exclusivity rules, and avoid conflicts, thereby maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the order fulfillment process.
