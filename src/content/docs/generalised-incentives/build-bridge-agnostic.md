Are you building a cross-chain application and are you tired of vendor lock-in? So are we!

At Catalyst, we have designed [Generalised Incentives](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives) to simplify cross-chain app development and let you choose the best AMB for your application using a common set of standardized incentives and interfaces.

Currently, Generalised Incentives support the following AMBs

- **Wormhole**: Full support via Generalised Relayer
- **Polymer**: Full support via Polymer's Relayer

You can read more about the benefits to [Generalised incentives on Github](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives?tab=readme-ov-file#generalised-incentive-escrow).

### The Case of Catalyst

Generalised Incentives allows Catalyst to be agnostic to interoperability protocol and allows us leverage any arbitrary message bridge (AMB) to send the Unit of Liquidity across chains. This is facilitated at the same time that our users experience the same consistent good UX as any AMB has the same interface. As a result, Catalyst is guranteed to be the liquidity protocol with most supported chains.
