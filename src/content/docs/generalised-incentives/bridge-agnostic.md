Catalyst is agnostic to interoperability protocol and can leverage any arbitrary message bridge (AMB) to send the UoL across chains. As a result, Catalyst is guranteed to be the liquidity protocol with most supported chains.

This is facilitated through our bridge incentive scheme called [Generalised Incentives](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives) which standardizes interfaces and incentives between AMBs. This allows us to support any AMB while the same user experience.

The following AMBs are currently supported by Generalised Incentives:
- Wormhole
- Polymer
