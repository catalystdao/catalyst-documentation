Catalyst strives to support and contribute to improving the standard to better support resource locks and make ERC-7683 more future-proof.

## General Incompatibilities

* ERC-7683 places a lot of focus on the open interface. This makes sense, as the initial version of ERC-7683 was conceived before resource locks. However, with resource locks, it presents a challenge because orders donâ€™t always start with on-chain calls anymore.
* The ERC-7683 fill function is expensive because it works with memory, not calldata, due to the transparent bytes provided.

### Our Recommendations

* Add `address user` and `uint256 nonce` to `OnchainCrossChainOrder`.
  * Goal: To clarify who the depositor is. (Tokens should still be collected from `msg.sender`.)
* Convert the `open` event into `event Open(bytes32 indexed orderId, bytes resolveContext)` and add resolve functions that take the original order and `resolveContext` to accurately produce the `ResolvedCrossChainOrder` from an off-chain view call.
  * Goal: To reduce the cost of emitting the `Open` event.
* Make functions `open(...)` and `openFor(...)` optional.
  * Goal: To make it explicit that `open` should only be used for depositing.
* Make function `validate(...)` a view function that returns `(uint32 fillDeadline)` to easily validate whether an order is valid.
  * Goal: To provide an explicit way for pure off-chain orders to be validated.

Additionally, the specification should contain a description of how to integrate the lock flow: outputs first, inputs second.
