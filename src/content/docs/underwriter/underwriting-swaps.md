Underwriting is currently limited to very a list of pre-approved actors. We recommend starting by running a [relayer](/relayer/setup) to get experience with running Catalyst infrastructure.

Underwriting transactions require running a relayer. We recommend running the underwriter on the same VPS as the relayer. Underwriting requires a high degree of stability. As a result, the requirements are slightly higher to promote stability.

| Requirements | Minimum                | Recommended            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Processors   | 1 fast vCPU or 2 vCPUs | 2 vCPU or 3 slow vCPUs |
| Memory       | 2 GB                   | 2 GB                   |
