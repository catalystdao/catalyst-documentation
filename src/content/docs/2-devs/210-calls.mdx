The default output type of Catalyst, called `OutputDescription`, supports secondary calls. This allows you to schedule calldata to be executed after the delivery of the asset.

:::caution[Outputs are filled unorderly]
Outputs are filled unorderly. As a result, if you want to receive both Ether and USDC to your destination contract and then execute a call using both Ether and USDC, this may not be possible. This is because either USDC or Ether may arrive before the other, and as a result, the logic may not execute correctly.
:::

Natively, Catalyst will deliver the output of `OutputDescription` and then call the destination.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Implement callback handling for Cross cats payouts, both outputs and inputs.
 * @dev Callbacks are opt-in. If you opt-in, take care not to revert.
 * Funds are likely in danger if the calls revert. Please be careful.
 *
 * If you don't need this functionality, stay away.
 *
 * The recipient is called.
 */
interface ICrossCatsCallback {
    /**
     * @dev If the transaction reverts, 1 million gas is provided.
     * If the transaction doesn't revert, only enough gas to execute the transaction is given, plus a buffer of 1/63'th.
     * The recipient is called.
     * If the call reverts, funds are still delivered to the recipient.
     * Please ensure that funds are safely handled on your side.
     */
    function outputFilled(bytes32 token, uint256 amount, bytes calldata executionData) external;

    /**
     * @notice If configured, is called when the input is sent to the filler.
     */
    function inputsFilled(uint256[2][] calldata inputs, bytes calldata executionData) external;
}
```

Additionally, Catalyst provides a basic multicall handler with the following defined structs:

```solidity
struct Call {
    address target;
    bytes callData;
    uint256 value;
}

struct Instructions {
    // If set to an address (not address(0)), then the tokens sent to this contract on the call
    // will be approved for this address.
    address setApprovalsUsingInputsFor;
    // Calls that will be attempted.
    Call[] calls;
    // Where the tokens go if any part of the call fails.
    // Leftover tokens are sent here as well if the action succeeds.
    address fallbackRecipient;
}
```

When used: `executionData = abi.encode(Instructions)`.

For the default Catalyst `OutputDescription`:

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const outputDescription = `
struct OutputDescription {
    bytes32 remoteOracle;
    bytes32 remoteFiller;
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 token;
    uint256 amount;
    bytes32 recipient; // = addressOf(CatsMulticallHandler)
    bytes remoteCall; // = abi.encode(Instructions)
    bytes fulfillmentContext;
}`;

<Code code={outputDescription} lang="solidity" mark={['bytes32 recipient; // = addressOf(CatsMulticallHandler)', 'bytes remoteCall; // = abi.encode(Instructions)']} />
