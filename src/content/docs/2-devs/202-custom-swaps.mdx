This section assumes you are performing a native wallet integration. Your wallet will escrow funds for the Catalyst system while swaps are ongoing. Otherwise, see the [get started guide](/devs/get-started).

There are two ways to perform a native wallet integration:

1. Using an off-the-shelf solution like TheCompact or another _Wallet as a Service_ solution that has already been integrated.
2. Adding support for a new wallet integration.

**Catalyst does not currently support multi-chain inputs. If these are needed, please reach out and we will enable them. Note that this requires additional off-chain security measures to ensure safety.**

### Defining a Custom Input Settlement

If you are using an off-the-shelf solution (**1.**) and the current swap description is insufficient for your needs, or if you need to support a new wallet interface (**2.**), you need to write an Input Settlement contract to support these features. We recommend getting started by reading and understanding the [`CompactSettler.sol`](https://github.com/catalystsystem/catalyst-intent/blob/main/src/settlers/compact/CompactSettler.sol) and then basing your implementation on [`BaseSettler.sol`](https://github.com/catalystsystem/catalyst-intent/blob/main/src/settlers/BaseSettler.sol).

You need to implement a `finalise` interface which, when called, validates that the order has been filled and then correctly claims the input tokens and sends them to the solver.
