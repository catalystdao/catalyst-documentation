This section assumes you are doing a native wallet integration – Your wallet will escrow funds for the Catalyst system while swaps are ongoing – otherwise see the [simple swap guide](/integrate).

There are 2 ways of doing a native wallet integration:

1. Using an off-the-shelf solution like TheCompact or another _Wallet as a Service_ solution that has already been integration.
2. Adding support for a new wallet integration.

**Catalyst does currently not support multi chain inputs. If these are needed, reach out and we will enable them. Note that this requires additional off-chain security lifts to be safe.**

### Defining a custom input settlement

If you are using an off-the-shelf solution (**1.**) and the current swap description is insufficient for your needs or you need to support a new wallet interface (**2.**), you need to write a Input Settlement contract to support these features. We recommend getting started by reading and understand the [`CompactSettler.sol`](https://github.com/catalystsystem/catalyst-intent/blob/main/src/settlers/compact/CompactSettler.sol) and then similarly basing your implementation of [`BaseSettler.sol`](https://github.com/catalystsystem/catalyst-intent/blob/main/src/settlers/BaseSettler.sol).

You need to implement a `finalise` interface which when called, validates the order has been filled and then correctly claims the input tokens and sends them to the solver.
