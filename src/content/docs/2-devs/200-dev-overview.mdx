# For Wallet & App Developers

## Your Needs

As a wallet or application developer, you're likely facing these challenges:

- Providing competitive pricing for cross-chain bridging and swaps
- Supporting multiple blockchains with minimal technical overhead
- Offering an industry-leading cross-chain user experience

## How Catalyst Helps

### Immediate Access to Competitive Pricing

By integrating with Catalyst, you gain access to our network of solvers who compete to offer the best rates for your users' cross-chain transfers. This competition ensures your users consistently get favorable pricing without requiring you to manage liquidity sources.

### Simple Integration

Catalyst is designed to work with common resource lock standards like The Compact. No custom development is required, significantly reducing the engineering effort needed to support cross-chain functionality.

### Flexibility to Expand

As new blockchains emerge, you can easily expand your cross-chain support without compatibility concerns. Catalyst's architecture allows you to add new chains without rebuilding your integration.

### Better User Experience

Your users benefit from:
- Gasless swaps
- Best-in-market fulfilment times
- Consistent experience across different blockchains

## Integration Overview

Integrating with Catalyst involves three main steps:

1. **Implement resource locks** - Use one of our supported standards (like The Compact)
2. **Connect to the order server** - Broadcast user intents to our solver network
3. **Handle fulfillment callbacks** - Process completed transfers

Our full integration guide provides detailed instructions, code examples, and best practices for implementing each of these steps efficiently.
